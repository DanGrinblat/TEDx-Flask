Rich is a nationally recognized conservationist who had been Chagrin River Land Conservancy’s only executive director for 10 years when CRLC and seven other northern Ohio land trusts merged to form Western Reserve Land Conservancy in 2006. At that time, he became president and chief executive officer of the largest land conservancy in Ohio. In his talk Rich will explain the current state of Cuyahoga County’s population, giving background on what it used to be and insights on how it can increase and flourish in the future.
